# Typeformer

Typeformer is a very simply module. It allows a Drupal user to embed a full-
screen Typeform as a content node within their website. You can enjoy the
optimal Typeform experience while keeping your own domain/URL visible.

When creating a new Typeform content node, you simply provide:

- Page Title
- Typeform URL (example: https://augustash.typeform.com/to/AqkiB4)
